        <h1>proudly <i>crafted</i> in Calabar since 2009</h1>
        <p>
            All our products are handmade by local artisans who use ancestral techniques. Thanks to the unique know-how of each craftsman involved in the production chain, each product bears its own story, having benefited from unique and personalized care, from its preparation to its arrival in m√ºnich. The Ecuadorian Boutique is also a reference for Ecuadorian leather goods, jewelry and ready-to-wear brands.
